# Make, Buy or Lease Analysis: 

    ### 4.1.1 Intellectual property: All the libraries and frameworks used in the above code are open-source and available for free use, so there are no intellectual property issues to consider when using them.

    ### 4.1.2 Privacy: The code handles sensitive information, such as user emails and passwords, so it's important to consider privacy when making, buying, or leasing components for the system. It would be best to make sure that all components used in the system have robust privacy measures in place to protect this information.

    ### 4.1.3 Security: The code uses libraries such as bcrypt and jsonwebtoken to handle password hashing and token generation, which are both security-critical tasks. It would be best to make sure that all components used in the system have strong security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access or attacks.

    ### 4.1.4 Reliable expertise: It would be best to make sure that the team developing the system has the necessary expertise to use the libraries and frameworks used in the above code effectively.

    ### 4.1.5 Reliable capacity: It's important to consider the capacity of the team developing the system to ensure that they can meet the demand for the product.

    ### 4.1.6 Feasibility: It's important to consider the feasibility of using the libraries and frameworks used in the above code, as well as any other components that may be needed for the system. This includes making sure that the team has the resources and expertise to complete the project successfully within the given constraints.



# Software Reuse:

    ##### 4.2.1 Abstract level: The code uses concepts and ideas from existing libraries and frameworks, such as routing and middleware in the Express framework, but does not reuse any actual code.

    ##### 4.2.2 Object level: The code reuses individual objects or classes from the libraries and frameworks used, such as the User model from the mongoose library.

    ##### 4.2.3 Component level: The code reuses larger components or subsystems from the libraries and frameworks used, such as the mongoose library for interacting with the MongoDB database.

    ##### 4.2.4 System level: The code does not reuse an entire system or application as is.



# 1 Configuration Management

    #### V0.1.0.0: This is an alpha version of the system or product, with a major version of 1 and no minor or patch updates.


# 4.5 Development & Deployment Specification:

        ## 4.5.1 Hardware:

        CPU: A processor with at least two cores is recommended for running the web server and handling requests efficiently.
        RAM: At least 4 GB of RAM is recommended for running the web server and any other necessary software.
        I/O devices: The system will need access to input/output devices such as a keyboard and mouse, and potentially also a database server.
        Networking: The system will need access to a network connection to allow for communication with clients and the database server.

        ### 4.5.2 Software:

        OS: The code is written in JavaScript, which is typically run on a Unix-based operating system such as Linux or macOS.
        Web server: The 'express' library is used to create a web server that can handle HTTP requests and responses.
        Database: The code uses the 'mongoose' library to connect to a MongoDB database, which is used to store user and message data.
        Security: The 'bcrypt' library is used to hash passwords for secure storage, and the 'jsonwebtoken' library is used to generate JWTs for authentication.
        Libraries: The code uses several open-source libraries to perform various tasks, such as 'cors' for enabling CORS and 'body-parser' for parsing request bodies.

        ### 4.5.3 IDE/Compilers:

        The code does not require the use of a specific IDE or compiler, as it is written in JavaScript and can be run using a JavaScript runtime such as Node.js.
        ### 4.5.4 Testing tools:

        The code does not include any specific testing tools, but it is recommended to use unit testing and integration testing tools to ensure the quality and reliability of the system. Some popular options for testing JavaScript code include Mocha, Jest, and Jasmine.

# 4.6 Deployment/Physical Diagram:

        Below is a rough diagram of the deployment and physical components involved in the above code:

        [Web Client] <--HTTP requests/responses--> [Web Server] <--TCP/IP connections--> [MongoDB Database Server]

        Web Client: This represents the clients that are making HTTP requests to the web server, such as web browsers or mobile apps. In this case it will be our react app

        Web Server: This represents the server running the code <node js>, which handles HTTP requests and responses and communicates with the database server.

        MongoDB Database Server: This represents the server running the MongoDB database, which stores user and message data.
        The web server and database server can be hosted on separate physical machines or on the same machine, depending on the scale and performance requirements of the system. They can also be hosted in a cloud environment such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure.
